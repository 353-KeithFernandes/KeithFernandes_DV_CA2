    "  Trees and graphs are non-linear data structures where trees represent hierarchical relationships and graphs follow a network model. Among the main distinctions in trees, there is a single path between any two vertices, while a graph can have unidirectional and bidirectional paths. We also see that in a tree there is a root node and each child can have only one parent node, whereas a graph does not have the concept of a root node. Trees cannot have rings or rings of their own, but graphs can have such characteristics. We also see that diagrams are generally more complex due to the possibility of loops, while trees are simpler. In tree traversal it includes pre-order, in-order and post-order techniques whereas graph traversal uses BFS and DFS techniques. Trees can have n-1 edges, but the number of edges in a graph is not predefined. And finally, trees have a hierarchical structure and graphs have a network model."

    "The graph serves as an abstraction of a problem, simplifying and representing complex relationships between different entities. For many problems, the actual relationships or dependencies can be complex and difficult to visualize. Using a diagram as an abstraction, we create a simplified model that captures important relationships and interactions between different elements of the problem. The graph behaves like an abstraction in some ways, for example, the entities involved are abstracted as nodes in the diagram. These nodes can represent objects, events, locations, or other relevant elements. There may be relationships or connections between entities that are represented as edges in the diagram. These edges can have weights or other attributes that can capture the nature and strength of the relationship, in the overall structure of a graph, so the topology of the relationships is reflected. Providing a high-level view of how different elements are connected and how information or influence can flow through the system. Occurring in pathfinding, problems often involve finding paths or routes between different entities. Graphs provide a natural representation for pathfinding algorithms, helping to identify the most efficient or optimal routes. Many real-world problems involve complex systems with many interacting components. By bringing a problem together in a diagram, it is easier to simplify its presentation, making it more manageable, making it easier to analyze and understand the underlying structure. There are also, graph algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) can be used to solve various types of problems efficiently. These algorithms work on an abstract graph and provide solutions to problems such as connectivity, reachability, and network flow."
